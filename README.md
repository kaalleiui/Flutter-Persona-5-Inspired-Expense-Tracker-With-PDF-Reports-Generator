# expense_persona

A Flutter based expense tracker app.
- Following Persona 5 Theme of black, red and white color
- PDF Report Generator
- Fake confidants system with achievements simulation
- Using Hive for the backend

Bugs

- Need to click description again to add expenses
- Background box in report_screen needs adjustment since the size is too large for Android Display
- And a lot of other stuff I probably don't know
  
Written 40% by me (no cap), but I gave up halfway because it's annoying and just feed it to DeepSeek to finish everything up (my bad)
